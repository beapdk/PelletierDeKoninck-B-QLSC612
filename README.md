* Python  *(this was based on 3.7.6 version and used via *miniconda*). For Python installation tutorials, refer to either [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) or [pip](https://docs.python.org/3/using/index.html)

* Jupyter NoteBook *[Installation documentation](https://jupyter.org/install)

For scipy :  ```conda install scipy```
